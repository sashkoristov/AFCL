## Compound functions

AFCL introduces the following compound functions: [`sequence`](./compound/sequence.md), [`if-then-else`](./compound/sequence.md), [`switch`](./compound/sequence.md), [`for`](./compound/sequence.md), [`while`](./compound/sequence.md), [`parallel`](./compound/sequence.md), and [`parallelFor`](./compound/sequence.md). The specifications for the name attribute, dataIns and dataOuts ports, along with the corresponding source and saveto attributes are similar as for a base function. 

When we use the term function, it can refer to either base function or compound function.
